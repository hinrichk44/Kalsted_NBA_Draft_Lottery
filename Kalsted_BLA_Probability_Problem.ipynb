    "1.) The probability for getting the first pick is simply chances/total chances. For example, Team 1 has 114 chances and there are 1000 total chances. So P(1st Pick|Worst Record) = 114/1000 = .114\n",

For example, if Team 2 picked first, then the probability of Team 1 to get the second pick is 114/(1000-113). However, because we do not KNOW who picked first, we have to create a conditional probability where Team X selects first then Team Y selects second. That is calculated by Py * Sum[Px/(1-Px] where x is every instance of not team y picking first.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.) The probability for getting the third pick is Pn/(1000-Pi-Pk) where Pn is the chances of the third pick, Pi is the chances of either pick 1 or 2, and Pk is also the chances of pick 1 or 2. As before, we have to iterate over all scenarios where two different teams get the first two picks.\n",
